# Web Scraping Project

This project demonstrates three types of web scraping techniques using Python, `requests`, and `BeautifulSoup`. The following types of scrapes are implemented:

## Table of Contents

1. [Type 1: Page Scrape](#type-1-page-scrape)
2. [Type 2: SERP Scrape](#type-2-serp-scrape)
3. [Type 3: Sitemap Scrape](#type-3-sitemap-scrape)
4. [Requirements](#requirements)
5. [Usage](#usage)
6. [License](#license)

## Type 1: Page Scrape

### Description
This functionality allows you to scrape a specified webpage to extract various elements, including text content, headings (H1, H2, H3), and other relevant elements. 

## Type 2: SERP Scrape

### Description
This functionality performs a search query on a search engine (e.g., Bing), scrapes the search engine results page (SERP), and retrieves the URLs of the top 10 search results. Afterward, it performs a page scrape on each of those URLs.

## Type 3: Sitemap Scrape

### Description
This functionality fetches the `robots.txt` file of a website, extracts the sitemap URL, and then scrapes the sitemap to retrieve all the URLs listed within it.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `BeautifulSoup4` library
- `selenium` library
- WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome)

### Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium
```

## Usage
1. For **Type 1**, call the `scrape_page(url)` function with a valid URL.
2. For **Type 2**, call the `scrape_serp(search_query)` function with your desired search query.
3. For **Type 3**, call the `main(website_url)` function with the target website URL.
